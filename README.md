HTRU_2.csv contains Radio Telescope data from High Time Resolution Universe Survey (South). The 8 predictors are 
(i) mean (ii) SD (iii) kurtosis and (iv) skewness of the integrated signal profile 
(v) mean (vi) SD (vii) kurtosis and (viii) skewness of the dispersion measure vs signal-to-noise curve. 
Dispersion measure is the dispersion in the signal as it passes through the interstellar medium, and is related to the electron column density. 
These predictors were identified by Lyon et al., arXiv:1603.05166. 
The label is binary: 1 represents pulsar signals as annotated by human experts and 0 represents noise due to radio frequency interference.
